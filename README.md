# Fusion Security Lab

## What I did today (Day 1)
- Opened Security Console successfully
- Inspected my user roles:
  - Application Implementation Consultant
  - IT Security Manager
  - Employee
- Explored seeded role: Employee
  - Interesting Duty: Employee Self-Service Duty
  - Notable Function Security Policy: View Person Profile → allows employee to view their own profile
  - Notable Data Security Policy: Access to Person Records → restricts access so user sees only their own data

## Notes to self
- Role Hierarchy shows which duties a role inherits
- Function Security Policies control **what tasks/actions** a user can perform in UI
- Data Security Policies control **what data** a user can access (e.g., only their own department)
- Missing roles: none for now (I already have IT Security Manager + AIC)

## Next up
- Create a small custom role and assign it to a test user
